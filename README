=== HyperOps : A Sage package for hyper operations and iteration. ===

HyperOps provides functions for dealing with infinite power series, 
but also tries to be compatible with Sage's built-in power series,
and functions for continuous iteration, finding fixed points, and
generalized hyper operations (right, left, mixed, balanced, etc.).

=== Installation ===
