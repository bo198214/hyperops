Title: HyperSage - a Sage library for tetration and hyper operations.
Creator: Andrew Robbins
Date: 2008-04-22
Description:

    hyperops/polynomial.py contains basic polynomials.
    a_poly(x) makes an arbitrary polynomial function, 
    and h_poly(x) and p_poly(x) make hyperbolic and parabolic 
    functions, respectively.

    A better implementation of reversion(), because
    the one Sage has in sage/rings/power_series_poly.pyx
    called .reversion() is only implemented for QQ.
    
    The Lagrange-BŸrmann formula is:

    and since the expression after the "..." is a diagonal
    of a Bell or Carleman matrix, we use Carleman_matrix()
    to implement this function.
