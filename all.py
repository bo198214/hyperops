Title: HyperSage - a Sage library for tetration and hyper operations.
Creator: Andrew Robbins
Contributor: Jay D. Fox
Date: 2008-04-25
Description:

    hyperops/all.py 
    
    This is traditionally where Sage would put things to be
    included in the global namespace when you load the library.
    
    This would normally be accomplished with:
    
        from sage.all import *
        from hyper.all import *
    
    if you wanted to write your own modules to HyperSage.
