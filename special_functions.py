Description:

    hyper/special/funcion.py contains definitions of special 
    functions, especially those that are required by or useful
    for use with tetration. Some of these special functions
    include: x^x, x^(1/x), the infinitely iterated exponential, 
    the Lambert W function,

        two generalizations, but this seemed the simplest to me.

    # Notes:
    # 1) The code will loop until precision is within 8 bits of the full
    #    precision of the input field. However, the maxout variable is
    #    used to prevent an infinite loop, just in case.
    # 2) The perturb value is used to prevent a situation where the a0
    #    variable is so accurate that the axial variable can't be
    #    determined accurately. The number of bits of accyracy should
    #    roughly double with each iteration, so any inaccuracy introduced
    #    by perturb should easily be removed by another iteration.
